# **Overview**

This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing various stages of development, from prototypes to deprecated ideas. Below is a brief description of each folder and its contents:

---

## **Folder Structure**

### **1. Deprecated**
This folder contains older or discontinued projects that are no longer actively maintained.

- **Early_Proj/HIDd3n**  
  A series of experiments focused on HID (Human Interface Device) emulation and asynchronous web servers. Related to earlier ESP32 or Metro projects.

- **Packet Pals**  
  An early standalone version of my gamified wardriving project. Designed to capture Wi-Fi networks and generate unique creatures based on network statistics.

- **WDproto**  
  An early prototype related to the WD wardriving game project, deprecated due to changes in scope.

---

### **2. Functional - WIP**
This folder contains projects that are actively being developed and are functional, though still a work in progress.

- **EMMY WIP**  
  A project involving the **Enhanced Misinformation Mitigation for You (E.M.M.Y.)** tool. This tool integrates OCR and fact-checking capabilities with a lightweight and cross-platform design.

---

### **3. Nonfunctional - WIP**
This folder includes projects that are in early stages, incomplete, or under heavy development.

- **Comp_NoRans**  
  Older computational logic for a theoretical compression project that has yet to see completion.

- **DYW**  
  A compression system involving system snapshots, chunk storage, and infrastructure. Features a modular design for handling data and system bases.

- **WD**  
  The updated version of my STEM gaming concept. Runs on ESP32 and communicates with a companion app.

- **WD_Companion**  
  The companion app for my gamified STEM project. The app utilizes Flutter, enabling the creation of a single, cross-platform app. Currently struggling with **flutter_blue** and **flutter_blue_plus** implementation here.

---

## **Goals**
- Showcase my creative and technical problem-solving through real-world applications.
- Explore various platforms and technologies, including:
  - **ESP32** for IoT and hardware-based tools.
  - **Web technologies** for UI/UX and interactive interfaces.
  - **Cross-platform development** using Flutter.
  - **Gamified experiences** through projects like **Packet Pals**.

---

## **Future Plans**
- Further develop **EMMY** into a fully functional misinformation mitigation tool with advanced AI integrations.
- Revisit and refine the **Packet Pals** project to create a modern, polished version with gamification and network exploration.
- Finalize and document the **WD** and **WD_Companion** projects for potential release.
